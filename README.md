Qemu USB Tablet Driver
======================

Qemu can emulate a 'tablet' driver which comes handy when connecting via VNC.

Unfortunately, unlike Windows and Linux, OSX doesn't ship a compatible driver.

This simple userspace driver remedies to that problem.

Get the binary from: http://www.chui-pas.net/qemu/Qemu-Tablet-Driver-v1.0.pkg

To build from source, install http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html

Then simply run 'make' to generate a .pkg
